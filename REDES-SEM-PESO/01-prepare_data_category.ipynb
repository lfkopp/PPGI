       "'MOST OF MY KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS COME FROM LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND ARE CONSIDERED AT-RISK. THESE KIDS WALK TO SCHOOL ALONGSIDE THEIR PARENTS AND MOST HAVE NEVER BEEN FURTHER THAN WALKING DISTANCE FROM THEIR HOUSE. FOR 80% OF MY STUDENTS, ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE OR THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME.   WHILE MY KINDERGARTEN KIDS HAVE MANY OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF THEM, THEY COME TO SCHOOL EACH DAY EXCITED AND READY TO LEARN. MOST STUDENTS STARTED THE YEAR OUT NEVER BEING IN A SCHOOL SETTING. AT THE START OF THE YEAR MANY HAD NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO LETTERS. EACH DAY THEY SOAK UP MORE KNOWLEDGE AND TRY THEIR HARDEST TO SUCCEED. THEY ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO LEARN NEW THINGS EVERY DAY. WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR AND THEY ARE STARTING TO TAKE OFF. THEY KNOW KNOW ALL LETTERS, SOME SIGHT WORDS, NUMBERS TO 20, AND A MAJORITY OF THEIR LETTER SOUNDS BECAUSE OF THEIR HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION. I AM EXCITED TO SEE THE PLACES WE WILL GO FROM HERE!I CURRENTLY HAVE A DIFFERENTIATED SIGHT WORD CENTER THAT WE DO DAILY DURING OUR LITERACY STATIONS. THE STUDENTS HAVE ACTIVITIES THAT RELATE TO WHATEVER SIGHT WORD LIST THEY ARE ON. THIS IS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE STATION ACTIVITIES. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH ENGAGING WAYS TO PRACTICE THEIR SIGHT WORDS.   I DREAM OF HAVING THE STUDENTS USE QR READERS TO SCAN THE SIGHT WORDS THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH AND THE IPODS READING THE SIGHT WORDS WITH THEM. THIS WOULD HELP SO MANY OF MY STUDENTS BY GIVING THEM MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO THE WORDS. MY STUDENTS NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN GO OVER THESE SIGHT WORDS DAILY AND I CANT ALWAYS GET AROUND TO EVERYONE TO PRACTICE THEIR FLASHCARDS WITH THEM. WITH THE IPODS THEY WOULD STILL HAVE A WAY TO PRACTICE THEIR SIGHT WORDS ON A DAILY BASIS.'"
